# Java Sorting Visualizer

A Java Swing application that visualizes common sorting algorithms by animating array element swaps in real time.

## Features
- Real-time visualization of sorting algorithms
- Custom Swing rendering panel
- Random array generation
- Clear step-by-step animation of algorithm behavior

## How to Run
1. Open the project in IntelliJ or VS Code  
2. Run `App.java` (or your Main class)

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Swing
- Object-Oriented Design

## What I Learned
This project helped me better understand sorting algorithms by visualizing their behavior, and strengthened my experience with Java Swing and event-driven programming.
